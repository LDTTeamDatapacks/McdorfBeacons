# MineColonies Beacons Datapack by Mcdorf#8652

The Beacons affect the colonist from Minecolonies, villagers from Minecraft, and golems.  They don't all receive the same effects.

Beacon:

* Level 1 vanilla effects player only 20 block radius
* Level 2 vanilla effects player only 30 block radius
* Level 3 vanilla effects player only 40 block radius
* Level 4 vanilla effects player only 50 block radius
* Level 5 upgraded effects 65 block radius
* Level 6 upgraded effects 95 block radius
* Level 7 upgraded effects 155 block radius
* Level 8 advanced upgraded effects 275 block radius

What are the extra effects?  Go do some testing.
For a full 6 beacon pyramid, you will need about 1.5k ore blocks and copper does not work
 
It will take a long time without an iron farm to be able to actually max out a beacon
